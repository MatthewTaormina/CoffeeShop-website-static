        <h2>Our Story <img src="img/canadian-flag.svg" alt="Canadian Flag" title="Canadian Flag" class="canadian-flag" width="24" height="16"></h2>
        <p>
          Founded in the heart of Toronto, Coffee Heaven began as a dream to create more than just a coffee shop—we wanted to build a community hub where authentic Canadian hospitality meets exceptional coffee. Our journey started with a simple belief: every cup should tell a story, and every visit should feel like coming home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're proud to be Toronto-born and Canadian-rooted, celebrating our heritage through carefully curated menu items that honor both traditional Canadian flavors and contemporary coffee culture. From our signature Maple Latte to our beloved Double Double Classic, every drink reflects our commitment to quality and our love for this beautiful country.
